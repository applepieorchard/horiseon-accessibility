# Horiseon Website

## Description

This is the website of Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc. It's purpose is to depict the importance of the various visibility services they offer. This project was built with accesibility considerations in mind, therefore it uses many semantic elements within the source code in order to achieve this. 

From this project I have learned the various semantic tags that can be used in place of simple divs and spans and how to balance the creation of these tags with the existing CSS in order to ensure the webpage is not broken in the process.
